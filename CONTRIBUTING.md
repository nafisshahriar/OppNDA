## Code Style

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

```python
def calculate_metrics(data: pd.DataFrame, metrics: list[str]) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate specified metrics from simulation data.
    
    Args:
        data: DataFrame containing simulation results
        metrics: List of metric names to calculate
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping metric names to calculated values
    """
    ...
```

### JavaScript

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable names

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues when applicable
